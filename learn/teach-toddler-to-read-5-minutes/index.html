<p>Teaching your toddler to read does not have to feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>In fact, just five minutes a day is enough.</p>
<p>When done consistently, short, focused practice builds real reading skills — without stress.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. Reading Is Simpler Than You Think</h2>
<p>Reading begins with one essential skill:</p>
<p>Knowing the <strong>sounds</strong> letters make.</p>
<p>When a child knows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>M says /mmm/</li>
<li>A says /aaa/</li>
<li>T says /t/</li>
</ul>
<p>They are building the foundation for reading.</p>
<p>Mastering letter sounds (the foundation of phonics) is the first and most important step.</p>
<p>And it can be taught in tiny daily sessions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Why Five Minutes Works</h2>
<p>Toddlers have short attention spans. That&#39;s just how they&#39;re wired.</p>
<p>Short sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep energy high</li>
<li>Prevent frustration</li>
<li>Build confidence</li>
</ul>
<p>Five calm, focused minutes every day is far more powerful than one long session once a week.</p>
<p>Consistency beats intensity.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Focus on Small Wins</h2>
<p>Do not try to teach all 26 letter sounds at once.</p>
<p>That feels overwhelming for both of you.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on identifying which sounds your child already knows — and which ones need strengthening.</p>
<p>Progress should feel steady and manageable.</p>
<p>When children feel successful, they want to continue.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. What a 5-Minute Session Looks Like</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s get practical. Here is a simple structure you can follow every day.</p>
<p><strong>Minute 1–2: Review Known Sounds</strong></p>
<p>Show several letters your child has practiced before.</p>
<p>Ask, “What sound is this?”</p>
<p>If the sound is strong and immediate, praise them and set that letter aside.</p>
<p>If they hesitate or don’t know it, add it to today’s pile.</p>
<p>Once you hit three letters in today&#39;s pile, you&#39;re done!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Minute 3–4: Study Those 3 Sounds</strong></p>
<p>Focus only on those three.</p>
<p>Say the sound together.</p>
<p>Repeat it a few times.</p>
<p>If the sound is wholly new (or forgotten), work on identification rather than recall. You say the sound, and have the child point at the correct letter. </p>
<p>Once they get good at identification, move to recall. You point at the letter, and the child says the sound. </p>
<p>If one feels especially difficult, that is okay.<br>It will return in tomorrow’s rotation.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Minute 5: Play a Quick Game</strong></p>
<p>End with something fun.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the three letters on the floor and have them jump onto the correct one when you call it out.</li>
<li>Hide the letters around the room and “hunt” for them.</li>
<li>Let your child teach the sound to a stuffed animal.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>5. Keep It Predictable</h2>
<p>Choose the same time and place each day.</p>
<p>After breakfast.<br>Right after coming back from daycare.<br>After bathtime.</p>
<p>Making practice routine keeps it predictable for both you and the child. When it&#39;s an irregular task, your child is more likely to push back or propose an alternate activity. </p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Why This Works</h2>
<p>Reviewing strong sounds every day builds confidence.</p>
<p>At the start of each session, your child is answering correctly. They feel capable. They feel successful. That confidence carries into the rest of the lesson.</p>
<p>When you identify weak letters, you narrow your focus. </p>
<p>Instead of teaching everything, you concentrate on just three sounds that need attention. That means your child gets a few minutes of highly targeted practice.</p>
<p>Five minutes may not sound like much.</p>
<p>But these are five personalized, one-on-one minutes. That&#39;s more than a child receives in a typical classroom. </p>
<p>Keeping it short also protects momentum. You get in and out before the child has a chance to get bored.</p>
<p>You do not have to be perfect.</p>
<p>You just have to start.</p>

<p>To help you start today, <a href="/files/Letter-Sounds-swiftflashcards.com.pdf">here is a free printable PDF</a> of beginner letter flashcards with simple sound guides on the back for parents.</p>
<p>The front of each card is a letter (in both uppercase and lowercase). That side is for your child.</p>
<p>The back is a reference word for you to get the correct primary sound for each word.</p>
<p>If you want a quick way to put these cards together, I wrote a tutorial on <a href="/learn/make-flashcards-at-home">how you can use playing card sleeves to DIY flashcards</a>.</p>
