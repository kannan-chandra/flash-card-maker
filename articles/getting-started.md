# Getting Started

Use this section for long-form docs and how-to articles.

## Where to add articles

Create markdown files in the `articles/` folder at the project root.

- `articles/getting-started.md` becomes `/learn/getting-started`
- `articles/my-first-export.md` becomes `/learn/my-first-export`

## Markdown support

Articles are rendered with GitHub-flavored markdown.

```md
# Title

A paragraph with **bold text** and `inline code`.

- Bullet one
- Bullet two
```
