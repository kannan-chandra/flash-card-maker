# Teach Your Toddler to Read in 5 Minutes a Day

Teaching your toddler to read does not have to feel overwhelming.

In fact, just five minutes a day is enough.

When done consistently, short, focused practice builds real reading skills — without stress.

## 1. Reading Is Simpler Than You Think

Reading begins with one essential skill:

Knowing the **sounds** letters make.

When a child knows that:

* M says /mmm/
* A says /aaa/
* T says /t/

They are building the foundation for reading.

Mastering letter sounds (the foundation of phonics) is the first and most important step.

And it can be taught in tiny daily sessions.

## 2. Why Five Minutes Works

Toddlers have short attention spans. That's just how they're wired.

Short sessions:

* Keep energy high
* Prevent frustration
* Build confidence

Five calm, focused minutes every day is far more powerful than one long session once a week.

Consistency beats intensity.

## 3. Focus on Small Wins

Do not try to teach all 26 letter sounds at once.

That feels overwhelming for both of you.

Instead, focus on identifying which sounds your child already knows — and which ones need strengthening.

Progress should feel steady and manageable.

When children feel successful, they want to continue.

## 4. What a 5-Minute Session Looks Like

Let's get practical. Here is a simple structure you can follow every day.

**Minute 1–2: Review Known Sounds**

Show several letters your child has practiced before.

Ask, “What sound is this?”

If the sound is strong and immediate, praise them and set that letter aside.

If they hesitate or don’t know it, add it to today’s pile.

Once you hit three letters in today's pile, you're done!

---

**Minute 3–4: Study Those 3 Sounds**

Focus only on those three.

Say the sound together.

Repeat it a few times.

If the sound is wholly new (or forgotten), work on identification rather than recall. You say the sound, and have the child point at the correct letter. 

Once they get good at identification, move to recall. You point at the letter, and the child says the sound. 

If one feels especially difficult, that is okay.
It will return in tomorrow’s rotation.

---

**Minute 5: Play a Quick Game**

End with something fun.

Examples:

* Place the three letters on the floor and have them jump onto the correct one when you call it out.
* Hide the letters around the room and “hunt” for them.
* Let your child teach the sound to a stuffed animal.

## 5. Keep It Predictable

Choose the same time and place each day.

After breakfast.
Right after coming back from daycare.
After bathtime.

Making practice routine keeps it predictable for both you and the child. When it's an irregular task, your child is more likely to push back or propose an alternate activity. 

---

## 6. Why This Works

Reviewing strong sounds every day builds confidence.

At the start of each session, your child is answering correctly. They feel capable. They feel successful. That confidence carries into the rest of the lesson.

When you identify weak letters, you narrow your focus. 

Instead of teaching everything, you concentrate on just three sounds that need attention. That means your child gets a few minutes of highly targeted practice.

Five minutes may not sound like much.

But these are five personalized, one-on-one minutes. That's more than a child receives in a typical classroom. 

Keeping it short also protects momentum. You get in and out before the child has a chance to get bored.

You do not have to be perfect.

You just have to start.

The front of each card is a letter (in both uppercase and lowercase). That side is for your child.

The back is a reference word for you to get the correct primary sound for each word.
