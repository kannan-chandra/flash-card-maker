# Getting Started

Use this section for long-form docs and how-to articles.

## Where to add articles

Create markdown files in the `guides/` folder at the project root.

- `guides/getting-started.md` becomes `/guides/getting-started`
- `guides/my-first-export.md` becomes `/guides/my-first-export`

## Markdown support

Guides are rendered with GitHub-flavored markdown.

```md
# Title

A paragraph with **bold text** and `inline code`.

- Bullet one
- Bullet two
```
